		<h1> My Code Plateau experience </h1>
		<br> The training kicked off on a good basis, with the instructors taking their time to put us through the basics of software development and ever since, the intensity of the training has been increasing on a daily basis. I don't find this increasing intensity to b frustrating or discouraging rather I find it to be challenging for nothing good comes easy in this life.
